Welcome!

This is the client for the Akashic life repository and planner app. This app is designed by a developer with terrible ADHD, inspired by that ADHD, to help others with ADHD handle the mayhem of managing day to day life in an organized manner. Currently the app is in early development with most of the core features implemented and working, with much of the work ahead having to do with expanding on those features and improving user experience of navigating the site. 

The goal for this app is to make it the easiest possible option when faced with moments in life where you must write something down, without that option being a piece of paper, or a post-it note, or a scribbling in a notebook or physical planner, or a digital note in a word document, or even a note typed into Notion or other favorite planner app of choice that is ultimately destined to vanish into the noise of all the other notes. 

Much of the roadmap has to do with reducing friction during usage of this app as much as possible towards this end, making it easy to jot things down and plan things out and easily retrieve that later, with a suite of features to help visualize trends over time, such as with the habit tracking feature.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas & Optional Enhancements

-   Broadly speaking, the following will guide future enhancements:
    -   Intelligent Quick Capture: Implement a universal, persistent "quick add" button or a keyboard shortcut that is accessible from any screen within the app. This feature should allow a user to instantly jot down a note, task, or idea without needing to navigate to a specific section. It could use natural language processing to automatically categorize the input (e.g., "call mom tomorrow at 3pm" would create a task and a reminder).

    -   Contextual Auto-Suggestions: As a user types, the app can offer contextual suggestions. For example, if a user is in the Notes section and types "meeting with", the app could suggest contacts or past meeting notes. In the Planner, typing "dentist" could suggest creating an event or a reminder.

    -   Voice-to-Text Integration: ADHD brains often struggle with the motor skills required for typing, especially during a rush of ideas. Integrating a robust, built-in voice-to-text function that works across all note-taking and task-creation fields would remove this barrier.

    -   Gamification and Dopamine Loops: To combat task initiation paralysis, you can incorporate small, celebratory visual or auditory rewards for completing tasks. This can be as simple as a satisfying animation or sound effect upon checking a box. The habit tracking and progress visualization features you already mentioned are excellent examples of this.

    -   Minimalist & Adaptable UI: The UI should be clean and uncluttered by default to minimize visual overstimulation. Allow users to customize their view, hiding or showing specific modules (e.g., a "dashboard at a glance" page that shows only the most relevant information like today's tasks and events).

    -   Cross-Platform Synchronization & Offline Access: The app must be fully functional offline and sync seamlessly across all devices, so a user can capture a thought on their phone and see it instantly on their desktop without any extra effort.

### Overall

-   [ ] **Performance Improvements**:
    -   [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders (use `memo` and `useMemo`).
    -   [ ] Remove excessive console logs.
-   [ ] **End-to-end Encryption**:
    -   [ ] Consider implementing end-to-end encryption of user data.
-   [ ] **User-friendly Features**:
    -   [ ] When an `objectId` is shown, link it to the object's detail page.
    -   [ ] Implement a **Help Widget** (a `?` icon) that shows a tooltip on hover and a popover on click.
-   [ ] **Nav**:
    -   [ ] Refactor the `nav.jsx` file to be more modular.
-   [ ] **Styling**:
    -   [ ] Begin homogenizing the style across the site to create a consistent look.

### Planner

-   [ ] **Calendar variants**:
    -   [ ] Reduce redundant calendar components that all render dots on days with data.

---

### Notes

-   [ ] **Explorer**:
    -   [ ] Make an alternate layout for wider screens with the task list in a sidebar.

    -   [ ] Consider a "slow-mode timer" that pauses checking until a new reminder is created or the next notification time approaches.
    -   [ ] Need a clear distinction between **Recurrence Rules** and **Trigger Dates**.
    -   [ ] Make a backend function that takes a `reminderId` and creates a notification.
-   [ ] **Landing Pages**:
    -   [ ] Create a landing page, hero, pricing page, FAQ, and about page.
    -   [ ] Brainstorm the dashboard landing page.
